that sharing is not just a selfless act. Sharing has concurrent and
lasting benefits, multiplied for the giver, the receiver, and
communities at large.

The online communities that we've created together are a global
platform for sharing. If we want to live in a digital world that is
fair, diverse, vibrant, serendipitous, and safe for everyone, we will
have to choose to make it that way. If that world is going to be
accessible, equitable, and full of innovation and opportunity, it will
require our leadership to foster and defend these ideals. Founded in
2001, Creative Commons has created legal and technical infrastructure
that is fundamental to the Web we know and love. Today, our work goes
beyond the ubiquitous CC licenses to foster cooperation and sharing,
support collaborative communities, and drive engagement across the
spectrum of open knowledge and free culture.

Creative Commons is a global charity, with an powerful affiliate
network of researchers, activists, legal, education and policy
advocates, and volunteers who serve as CC representatives in over 85
countries.  Together, we lead this ever-growing global
movement. Whether it's open education, open data, science, research,
music, video, photography, or public policy, we are putting sharing
and collaboration at the heart of the Web. In doing so, we are much
closer to realizing our vision: unlocking the full potential of the
Internet to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity.

I am proud to share with you our 2015 State of the Commons report, our
best effort to measure the immeasurable scope of the commons by
looking at the CC licensed content, along with content marked as
public domain, that comprise the slice of the commons powered by CC
tools.  We are proud to be a leader in the commons movement, and we
hope you will join us as we celebrate all we have accomplished
together this year.
