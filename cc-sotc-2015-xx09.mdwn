## 2015 Impact:<br /> CC + Foundation Open Policy {.impact .img-policy}

CC continues to lead the way in advocating for major philanthropic
foundations to adopt open licensing policies. Foundations can
exponentially expand the impact and reach of their grantmaking through
a "default open" policy that ensures that all grantees openly license
any digital outputs of their work, an important shift that has a
tremendous ripple effect.
