<h1 id="creative-commons----state-of-the-commons">Creative Commons -- State of the Commons</h1>
<p>Collaboration, sharing, and cooperation are a driving force for human evolution. Creative Commoners have known this fact all along, and recently there has been a flurry of new research to explain why. We are hardwired for sharing. Harvard professor on evolutionary dynamics Martin Nowak calls it the essential &quot;snuggle for survival” — evidence that sharing is not just a selfless act. Sharing has concurrent and lasting benefits, multiplied for the giver, the receiver, and communities at large.</p>
<p>The online communities that we’ve created together are a global platform for sharing. If we want to live in a digital world that is fair, diverse, vibrant, serendipitous, and safe for everyone, we will have to choose to make it that way. If that world is going to be accessible, equitable, and full of innovation and opportunity, it will require our leadership to foster and defend these ideals. Founded in 2001, Creative Commons has created legal and technical infrastructure that is fundamental to the Web we know and love. Today, our work goes beyond the ubiquitous CC licenses to foster cooperation and sharing, support collaborative communities, and drive engagement across the spectrum of open knowledge and free culture.</p>
<p>Creative Commons is a global charity, with an powerful affiliate network of researchers, activists, legal, education and policy advocates, and volunteers who serve as CC representatives in over 85 countries. Together, we lead this ever-growing global movement. Whether it’s open education, open data, science, research, music, video, photography, or public policy, we are putting sharing and collaboration at the heart of the Web. In doing so, we are much closer to realizing our vision: unlocking the full potential of the Internet to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity.</p>
<p>I am proud to share with you our 2015 State of the Commons report, our best effort to measure the immeasurable scope of the Commons by looking at the CC licensed content, along with content marked as public domain, that comprise the slice of the Commons powered by CC tools. We are proud to be a leader in the Commons movement, and we hope you will join us as we celebrate all we have accomplished together this year.</p>

<h1 id="impact-cc-open-education">2015 Impact: CC + Open Education</h1>
<p>CC is at the very heart of the open education movement; our licenses put the &quot;open&quot; in Open Educational Resources (OER). CC and our open education partners are leading an international OER campaign to make it easy for educators and students around the world to freely share curriculum, textbooks and research at near zero cost. CC is also helping governments add open licensing requirements on publicly funded educational resources.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-for-sharing">Thank You For Sharing!</h2>
<p>It’s been a remarkable year, most notably for the more than 1.1 billion works under one of the CC licenses, CC0, or the public domain mark. CC licenses offer an elegant solution; a release valve to the constraints of copyright. But it’s much bigger than that: Creative Commons has become a steward of our global Commons, a universe of openly-licensed content that has the power to spark everyday ideas and solve global challenges. We’ve unlocked the door to an alternate reality of free and open content, powered by millions of creators who share our values.</p>
<p>But the key challenge facing the Commons today isn’t quantity — it’s usability, vibrancy, and collaboration. Today’s web is social and interconnected, and it has completely changed the way we share, tell stories, and build communities. While integral to many kinds of creativity and sharing, Creative Commons has yet to fully activate the content and creators in our movement. We need our contributors to be able to talk to each other, find new content, give feedback, offer gratitude, get analytics, and build networks around the content they are creating. We need to light up the global Commons.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll join us and help build a more creative, free, and open Commons. Together we’ll be much closer to realizing our vision: unlocking the full potential of the Internet to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity.</p>
<p>Thank you to our Creative Commons Affiliate Network who work tirelessly everyday to protect and enrich the Commons. We also owe our thanks to Google and the many CC platforms, partners, institutions, and individuals from the broader open web community who contributed the essential data and information for this report. Simply put, our 2015 State of the Commons report would not be possible without your valuable contributions. Thank you!</p>
