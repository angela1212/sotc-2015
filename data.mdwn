## <span id="h.6lt5bddwy4ky"></span>Measuring CC’s slice of the Commons

This is the second year that Creative Commons has published a State of the Commons report. CC doesn’t host or control the content in the commons, which is hosted on a myriad of platforms and is made up of every type of media and data. We see this as an iterative process, where each year we improve our process and get better results. As with any large-scale global movement, it is impossible to quantify the full impact of our work. For example, how do we capture content that is insufficiently marked, or content that is in the public domain in some jurisdictions and not in others? When CC licensed work is remixed, how do we know when one work ends and another begins?

That said, we do have a handful of valuable tools that we’ve put to good use to tell the story of the CC licensed Commons and its massive growth. Building on the baseline we established with the [2014 State of the Commons reporting format](https://github.com/creativecommons/stateofthe/blob/master/data/notes.md), we continue to track size, scope, content, and diversity of the Commons. We added new stats from our servers, including [widespread use](#in-2015-cc-licensed-works-were-viewed-online-136-billion-times) of our CC license buttons and [views](#people-are-sharing-with-cc-licenses-in-as-many-as34-languageswith-more-than-90-million-views-of-ccs-deeds-in-the-last-ten-years) of license deeds in different languages. We also added [new usage data from more platforms](#cc-is-everywhere-millions-of-websites-use-cc-licenses-including-major-platforms-like-wikipedia-and-flickr-and-smaller-websites-like-your-grandmas-blog.) hosting the majority of CC licensed content on the web. We aimed for variety in representation, both by media type and domain of content, and we focused on highly trafficked platforms with CC integrations up to the technical standard that would allow us to track this data over time. We also added sections on CC’s broader impact as a steward of our global Commons. We dug a bit deeper into open education, policy, and our shared cultural heritage in an aim to measure not just the quantity of the Commons, but the incredible impact that a robust Commons can have on different regions of world.

Still, given the breadth and reach of CC’s global diversity, this year’s report can’t fully capture the true scope of CC’s international impact. Our aim is to continue to refine our process each year, including a more in-depth, collaborative process that reflects the geographical breadth of CC content in different languages (see [CC license use on the Polish web](http://ngoteka.pl/bitstream/handle/item/318/exec%2520summary%2520crawl.pdf?sequence%3D1&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNHxFCvR4uP22LzkxmqFn9NOnxDd_w), for example). We also hope to collaborate with domain experts and content partners in [open data](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data) and cultural heritage (what we like to call the [GLAM](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/GLAM) sector) to include those stats, and eventually track commons growth in those fields over time. With regard to the open policy landscape, we are already collaborating with our partners in the [Open Policy Network](http://openpolicynetwork.org) who are leading a State of Open Policy report for publication in early 2016.

Another huge undertaking on our wish list would be an effort to measure the public domain, not just the portion marked with our tools, but the entire public domain as it exists and as it is defined differently across jurisdictions. We may find that the topic merits a separate academic study and report, and look forward to outlining a best process for achieving and sharing comprehensive public domain data.

Ultimately, we want to be able to measure not just growth, but usability and vibrancy of the commons. The size of the Commons and its continued growth is most interesting when shared next to incredible stories of how the content is used by creators around the world to achieve CC’s [vision and mission](https://creativecommons.org/about). This is why we have begun to ask for new metrics from platforms on how CC works are used, including data points like number of downloads, users, and site trends.

## <span id="h.c8jrucmsqix"></span>“More than 1 billion CC licensed works in the Commons as of 2015”

Google provided us with the raw data, counting all of the gweb pages in its cache that link to Creative Commons license deeds, which we used to make the estimates in this report. While pages may link to Creative Commons license deeds for reasons other than to license or attribute works under them, we reason that those are vastly outnumbered by pages that indicate a CC license choice without linking to the deed. We’ve supplemented Google’s data with that of several websites that each have over a million CC-licensed works but aren’t reflected in Google’s data.

**Google data**

* Total web pages that link to current CC tools: 306,870,000
* Total web pages that link to retired CC tools: 10,030,000
* Grand total: 316,900,000

**Platforms not included in Google’s data**

* Total works across platforms listed below: 802 million

Google grand total 316,900,000 + total works across platforms (802 million) = 1,118,900,000 works (1.1 billion)

We cross-referenced data with sample size data from Bing which also put the total CC licensed or public domain works at just over 1 billion. This is still a low bound estimate, as we can’t know the total universe of platforms not included in Google’s data.

## <span id="h.gardfma85otn"></span>“More people are choosing to share openly!”

The bar graph showing breakdown by CC license and PD tool correspond to the following numbers which include Google data (web pages linking to current tools plus retired PD tool) and data from platforms not cached by Google (where we know the breakdown of works by license).

Total # of works reflected in bar graph: 1,008,283,451 (minus ~111 million works where the license was unspecified)

Breakdown by license: Google + *Platforms not cached by Google* = Total estimated works under that license

* CC BY: 114,660,000 + *129,354,310* = 244,014,310
* CC BY-SA: 67,800,000 + *305,756,937* = 373,556,937
* CC BY-ND: 5,350,000 + *19,215,096* = 24,565,096
* CC BY-NC: 11,130,000 + *45,793,028* = 56,923,028
* CC BY-NC-SA: 37,230,000 + *99,330,609* = 136,560,609
* CC BY-NC-ND: 47,340,000 + *90,361,041* = 137,701,041
* CC0: 21,950,000 + *372,095* = 22,322,095
* PDM: 1,410,000 + *1,220,335* = 2,630,335
* Retired PD tool: 10,010,000

Total Free Culture works (CC BY + CC BY-SA + Public domain): 652,533,677. CC uses the definition of free cultural works at Freedom Defined to categorize the CC licenses. “Free Culture” licenses allow for both commercial use and adaptations. Learn more at http://creativecommons.org/freeworks.

## <span id="h.edcwvxerta7m"></span>“The public domain is growing!”

The bar graph reflects the following data by year:

* Total public domain works marked with CC tools in 2006: 3,276,000 (no breakdown by tool)
* Total public domain works marked with CC tools in 2014: 17,557,500 (CC0: 10,310,000; PDM: 1,510,000; Retired PD tool: 5,737,500)
* Total public domain works marked with CC tools in 2015: 34,962,430 (CC0: 22,322,095; PDM: 2,630,335; Retired PD tool: 10,010,000)

Sources:

* 2006: 2.34% of 140 million from http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5936; marked under now [retired PD tool](http://creativecommons.org/retiredlicenses) 
* 2014: [Google data files](https://github.com/creativecommons/stateofthe/blob/master/data/notes.md#google-data-files)
* 2015: [Google data files](https://github.com/creativecommons/sotc-215/blob/master/googledata.csv) + Flickr (above)

Just as in 2014, we did not include PD totals from platforms other than Flickr, which we were able to confirm were not included in Google’s data. As such, the total public domain works marked by our tools is a low estimate. For example, Europeana alone reports over 10 million works under PDM or CC0.

## <span id="h.ac9uxyewspov"></span>“In 2015, CC licensed works were viewed online 136 billion times”

Views of CC works were calculated by combining two sets of data: the number of times CC license buttons were downloaded by a browser as part of viewing a web page, and the number of Wikipedia page views. [CC license buttons](https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads#Buttons) are hosted by the CC server; web pages that display our machine-readable code, as that from our [CC license chooser](http://creativecommons.org/choose), reference the CC license buttons hosted by our servers, which allow us to track each time a browser downloads the button image as part of someone viewing that page. In September 2015, CC license buttons were downloaded 552,015,520 times. We multiplied this number by 11.5 to achieve the approximate number of 6 billion views in 2015\. We combined 6 billion with the total number of page views of Wikipedia in 2015 ([130 billion](https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesPageViewsMonthly.htm)) to reach 136 billion views. Wikipedia pages do not use the machine-readable code referencing the CC license buttons and therefore are not included in our server data. Since we have not accounted for the many CC licensed works that do not reference the CC license buttons hosted on our servers and that are not Wikipedia, 136 billion is a low bound estimate.

## <span id="h.thiwln9a27at"></span>“To date, the 4.0 license suite has been officially translated into 7 languages, with 3 more to be published before the new year.”

Starting with the 4.0 license suite, CC instituted its first [Legal Code Translation Policy](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Legal_Code_Translation_Policy). Official translations of the 4.0 suite and CC0 are tracked at [https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Legal_Tools_Translation](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Legal_Tools_Translation).

## <span id="h.rtk23nbutn5"></span>“People are sharing with CC licenses in as many as 34 languages with more than 90 million views of CC’s deeds in the last ten years”

Prior to CC’s first official translation policy, CC affiliates unofficially translated license deeds for understanding around the world. Since CC launched the first version of its license suite in 2002, CC deed pages have been unofficially translated into at least 34 languages. 90 million views reflects the total number of views of these deed pages from January 1, 2005 through November 3, 2015, with 2005 marking the earliest period where tracking with Google Analytics is available for our servers. For those interested in a specific breakdown of deed pageviews by language, we have included that data here. Language categories with an asterisk may include variations on that language for simplicity, eg. Chinese includes simplified and traditional Chinese.

## <span id="h.hbeh8yiab37k"></span>Countries with Open Education policies

Countries listed have legislation, policies, or funder mandates at the national, provincial/state, or institutional level that lead to the creation, increased use, or support for improving OER. CC relied on our international open education partners to notify us of existing open education policies in their countries. For specific policy information, see the [OER Policy Registry](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/OER_Policy_Registry).

Total $ dispersed via policies to date:

* United States: 2,249,843,557 USD; 2,802,750,000 USD projected for 2015/16
* Canada: 16,040,000 CAD; 850,000 CAD projected for 2015/16
* Poland: 45 million Polish złoty (approximately 11 million Euro or 13 million USD)

## <span id="h.a2a43fg4mpcv"></span>“Open Textbooks have saved students $174 million to date, with an additional $53 million projected through academic year 2015/16”

Our open education partners collectively reported cost savings of $174,448,941 USD after replacing proprietary textbooks and materials with open textbooks licensed under CC. These savings are to date, inclusive of the 2015 fall term. These same partners projected collective cost savings of $53,427,667 USD for the 2015-2016 academic year.

Data was collected via an open call to the global open education community. All respondents were from North America. All respondents, projects, reported savings, and sources are listed below. Due to the diversity of the open education space, savings were calculated per individual project. We only included a project’s cost savings in the total if a methodology was provided. We also avoided duplication by verifying each project’s savings by year.

**Reported savings to date in 2015**

* All numbers are USD; savings reported in CAD have been converted using [www.oanda.com](http://www.oanda.com/)
* If a project reports $0, it is because the project has just started; it has not tracked savings to date; or the number was not verified by the source.
* Not all projects were able to provide projected savings, so the total is a low estimate.

Textbook savings calculated by looking at the actual number of students enrolled in each class, and then using the cost for the non-OER textbooks from the previous semester. Example: for ARTS 113, the previous non-OER text cost was $117.50\. Had the 315 students enrolled in the class this fall had to purchase the previous text, the total cost would have been $37,012.50\. The OER used in this class this semester is free, so we consider $37,012.50 to be the savings to our students. In total over the last three years 21,536 students have not had to purchase a textbook for a savings of $1.97 million.

In accomplishing the transition to CK-12 flexbooks we were able to save the cost of $80 per text and reallocate those funds to support our teachers who served as flexbook curators and to purchase chromebooks. So for students these textbooks, formerly $80 per text, are now $0 per text.

We are using an average per student savings estimate based on research done by national experts (David Wiley and Nicole Allen). They examined several research studies on open textbook savings and determined that $100 student savings was a reliable average. It takes several variables into consideration, including how many student buy used, rent, don't buy, etc.  As a network, we agreed on the $100/student method. Our members verified adoption of the book by faculty and then verified enrollments. We then apply the $100/student.

Based on feedback from students, about half of college students buy the paperback version of the textbook while the other half exclusively use the free PDF. The paperbacks are about $10, so we estimate savings per student to average about $100\. Through Oct 7th, 2015, we sold 14,838\. Subtracting out about 500 as books we've directly purchased for teachers and a couple thousand that are associated with one of the co-author's Coursera courses, we think $2 million is a conservative estimate. We also average around 15,000 to 20,000 textbook PDF downloads per month, though we don't know all the groups that are making use of the textbook. We don't include Coursera savings / value in our current estimates. We also do not estimate savings from our other free and open-source resources, e.g. in time savings for instructors who then do not need to develop their own resources from scratch.

UMUC's department of Learning Design and Solutions compiled the list of courses and the type of resource(s) used in each, as well as the previous price for textbooks in those courses. Using Fall, Spring, and Summer 2014 enrollment data, which I disaggregated by course, I estimated the cost-savings based on the price of each course's previous textbook times that course's enrollment for the aforementioned term.

## <span id="h.do3odxeld3ki"></span>“Together with The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, a longstanding open policy leader,  these foundations collectively made grants of approximately $1.9 billion in 2015”

To arrive at this figure, we added the annual grantmaking figures from the most recent year available (2013) as listed on [http://foundationcenter.org/](http://foundationcenter.org/). We assume those foundations will continue to make similar amounts of grants in the near future. The Gates Foundation policy applies only to research funding—it is not foundation-wide like the others. So we used the estimate of $900M/year quoted by [Science](http://news.sciencemag.org/funding/2014/11/gates-foundation-require-immediate-free-access-journal-articles).

Hewlett Foundation
