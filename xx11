Creative Commons Affiliate Network includes over 500 researchers,
activists, legal, education and policy advocates, and volunteers who
serve as CC representatives in over 85 countries. Working alongside
non-governmental institutions, universities, and public agencies, CC
affiliates employ region-specific approaches to copyright and intellectual
property that help solve local and global challenges. CC affiliates impact
the growth and quality of the commons across all sectors from education,
science, and research, to cultural heritage, data, design, and hardware.

program contribute their first round of OER to the Skills Commons

awarded funds to kick off new affiliate projects in El Salvador, Costa
Rica, and Paraguay, including a digital scanner for educational
institutions to provide online access to resources; a free digital
newsletter covering CC topics for Central America; and a mobile
