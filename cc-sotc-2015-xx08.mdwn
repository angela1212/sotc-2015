CC is at the very heart of the open education movement; our licenses
put the "open" in Open Educational Resources (OER). CC and our open
education partners are leading an international OER campaign to make
it easy for educators and students around the world to freely share
curriculum, textbooks and research at near zero cost. CC is also
helping governments add open licensing requirements on publicly funded
educational resources.
