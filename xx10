#### Museums and cultural institutions are choosing to share every day. {.img-frame}

###### Over 50 cultural institutions have made their permanent collections or records available for unrestricted use around the world under CC licenses or public domain tools, including: {.by}

#### Thanks to CC's public domain tools, digital images of outer space are made freely accessible and more broadly available to the public than ever before. {.img-pdmoon}

###### A collaboration with NASA, the Project Apollo Archive makes available thousands of images of the iconic Apollo moon missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s under the Public Domain Mark. {.by}

###### SpaceX, a private corporation, dedicates its photos to the public domain using CC0. {.by}

#### #FREEBASSEL: Lead of Creative Commons Syria, Bassel Khartabil is a key contributor to projects that digitize, preserve, and share cultural heritage. He has been illegally imprisoned in Syria since March 2012. CC and its Board of Directors continue to call for Bassel's immediate and safe release. {.img-bk}

###### Building on his invaluable contributions to the commons, Bassel's #NEWPALMYRA project features the 3D models of the ancient ruins of Palmyra, one of Syria's greatest archaeological treasures. The online community platform and data repository is dedicated to the preservation and creative reuse of data about Palmyra. {.by}
