It's been a remarkable year, most notably for the more than 1.1 billion
works under one of the CC licenses, CC0, or the public domain mark.
CC licenses offer an elegant solution; a release valve to the constraints
of copyright. But it's much bigger than that: Creative Commons has
become a steward of our global commons, a universe of openly-licensed
content that has the power to spark everyday ideas and solve global
challenges. We've unlocked the door to an alternate reality of free and
open content, powered by millions of creators who share our values.

But the key challenge facing the commons today isn't quantity -- it's
usability, vibrancy, and collaboration. Today's web is social and
interconnected, and it has completely changed the way we share, tell
stories, and build communities. While integral to many kinds of creativity
and sharing, Creative Commons has yet to fully activate the content and
creators in our movement. We need our contributors to be able to talk
to each other, find new content, give feedback, offer gratitude, get
analytics, and build networks around the content they are creating. We
need to light up the global commons.

We hope you'll join us and help build a more creative, free, and open
commons. Together we'll be much closer to realizing our vision:
unlocking the full potential of the Internet to drive a new era of
development, growth, and productivity.

Thank you to our Creative Commons Affiliate Network who work
tirelessly everyday to protect and enrich the commons. We also owe
our thanks to Google and the many CC platforms, partners, institutions,
and individuals from the broader open web community who contributed
the essential data and information for this report. Simply put, our 2015
State of the Commons report would not be possible without your
valuable contributions. Thank you!
